# Interactive Navigation Menu

## Overview

This project features an interactive navigation menu implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navigation menu is designed to be fixed at the top of the page and dynamically changes style based on user interaction and scrolling. The project demonstrates how to create a responsive, interactive navigation bar that enhances the user experience.
